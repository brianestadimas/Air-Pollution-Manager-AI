# AI Air Pollution Manager
Final project for the Building AI course

# Summary
In order to reduce Air Emissions and improve Air Quality in an area, Air Pollution Manager AI will take part as fault detectors on Buildings that are harmful to the Air Environment. <br/>
This AI Program measures Air Pollution Rate and Air Quality Index (AQI) on buildings. Program will collect input from Carbon Footprint rate (CO, CO2, CFCs, etc), particulate matter (PM), weather, and any other pollutant data in a building. Compares to other buildings around in that area. Then decisively detects fault on them.
